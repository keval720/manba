            specialized financial institution that supplies credit for the
            purchase of consumer goods and services by purchasing the time-sales
            contracts of merchants or by granting small loans directly to
            consumers. Specialized consumer finance agencies now operate
            throughout western Europe, Canada, the United States, Australia,
            Japan, and some Latin American countries. Although they existed in
            the early 1900s, their greatest development came after World War II.

            Large-sales finance companies, which operate by purchasing unpaid
            customer accounts at a discount from merchants and collecting
            payments due from consumers, were a response to the need for
            installment financing for the purchase of automobiles in the early
            1900s. Ally Financial, for example, was established as the General
            Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) in 1919 to purchase automobile
            accounts receivable from car dealers who were themselves unable to
            finance time purchases. Many companies in both Europe and the United
            States continue to specialize in financing purchases of particular
            commodities and remain closely associated with specific
            manufacturers. Some also extend credit for wholesale purchases by
            retail dealers.

            Consumer finance or small-loan companies also arose in the 1900s.
            Until then the need for consumer loans had been met primarily by
            illegal “loan shark” activities because it was unprofitable for
            banks to make small loans at rates below legally set usury levels.
            In 1911 several states in the United States began adopting
            small-loan laws that authorized loans to consumers at rates above
            usury levels, making it financially practical to operate a consumer
            loan business. Today many companies engage both in the sales-finance
            business and in making loans directly to consumers.
